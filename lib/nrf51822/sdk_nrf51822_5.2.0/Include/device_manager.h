 * @brief Device Manager Application Interface Abstraction..
 *
 * @details Device Manager Active and Bond Peers. Management of peer includes
 *          book keeping of contextual information book keeping like the Security Keys, GATT
 *          configuration and any application specific information.
 *
 *          Active Peers are devices which connected, and may or may not be bonded.
 *          Bonded Peers are devices which bonded, and may or may not be Active (Connected).
 *          Therefore, Active Bonded Peer refers to a device which is connected as well as
 *          bonded.
 *          Paired Devices or refers to peer devices that are connected and have necessary context
 *          establishment/exchange for the current connection session, however, on disconnection
 *          all contextual information is flushed. For example, SMP Information Exchanged during
 *          pairing, GATT Configuration etc is not retained on disconnection.
 *
 *          It should be noted that this module allows management of contextual information but not
 *          does provide an interface for connection management. Therefore, entering connectable
 *          mode, or connection establishment or disconnection of a link with peer is not in scope
 *          of this module.
 *
 *          For bonded peers, the contextual information is required to be retained on disconnection
 *          and on  power cycle, persistent storage of contextual information is handled by the
 *          module. This module categorizes the contextual information into 3 categories:
 *             - <b>Bonding Information</b>
 *               This information is the information exchanged between local and peer device to
 *               establish a bond. This information also includes peer identification information,
 *               like the peer address or the IRK or both. From here on this category of information
 *               is referred to as Device Context.
 *             - <b>Service/Protocol Information</b>
 *               This information is the information retained for the peer to save on one-time
 *               procedures like the GATT Service Discovery procedures, Service Configurations etc,
 *               allowing devices to resume data exchange on subsequent reconnection without having
 *               to perform initial set-up procedures each time. From here on this category is
 *               referred to as Service Context.
 *             - <b>Application Information</b>
 *               This information is the context that the application would like to associate with
 *               each of the bonded device. For example, if application chooses to rank its peers
 *               in order to manage them better the rank information could be treated as
 *               Application Information. This provision is provided to save the application from
 *               maintaining a mapping table with each Device Instance and Application Information.
 *               However, if application have no use case to make use of this, it is possible to not
 *               use or employ this at compile time. From here on this category of information is
 *               referred to as Application Context.

 * @brief Set Service Context for a peer device identified by 'p_handle' parameter.
 *
 * @details This API allows application to Set Service Context for a peer device identified by
 *          'p_handle' parameter. This API is useful when Service Context cannot be requested
 *          from SoftDevice, but needs to assembled by the application or an another module or when
 *          service context is exchanged in an out of band way.
 *          This API could also be used to trigger a storing of service context into persistent 
 *          memory. If this is desired, a NULL pointer could be passed to the p_context.
 *
 * @param[in] p_handle Identifies peer device for which procedure is requested.
 *
 * @param[in] p_context Service context being set. The context information includes length of
 *                      data and pointer to the contextual data being set. The memory pointed to by
 *                      the pointer to data is assumed to be resident when API is being called and
 *                      can be freed or reused once the set procedure is complete. Set procedure
 *                      completion is indicated by the event \ref DM_EVT_SERVICE_CONTEXT_STORED.
